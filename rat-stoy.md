# Part I.

## Intro

In each city in North America there is a family of rats living in the sewer system that is different from the rest. They have a faint glow, so faint that it can only be seen in the thick blanket of darkness in the sewer - that lightlessness that rests upon you heavily, and assures you that you are nowhere and you are nothing in the sewer, and so is everyone else there with you.

But indeed the glow is seen. Those tame rats who do not glow and who have almost forgotten how to see are once in a while reminded. When the cool sloshing floor of a tunnel becomes a snaking stream, when the rough hard walls become a gently curving cradle, when the flow from one pipe to another becomes a great waterfall that paints newborn shadows onto newborn canvasses - when a Candle appears, the glow is seen

In the city whose only remembered name is *Around*, these encounters are to be handled with great reluctance. A tame rat caught in the glow is not blinded but definitely alarmed, as if this nigh-extinguished light down the hall is as loud as a shotgun blast from the same range. Her surroundings become visible and uncanny. Her instinct is to flee, but that is not always wise. She stands still and straight, and squints her eyes to stare down the Candle. The Candle, having no similar warning sign, only now sees her. They return the gesture. Their awkward look of acknowledgement betrays uncertainty to the tame rat. She responds with nothing. So they stand for five whole seconds. The Candle seems to recall what is expected of them, and turns around to wait for the tame to leave. And she does.

So it goes in the sewers this year. Certainly it is more amicable than the last few decades have been, though *amicable* may not be the exact word used underground. History as it transpired more than 25 years in the past is not in public memory - the pre-Disaster days are not for most to know about. There are murmurs that the Candle did not exist before Disaster, and that all rats were tame. The murmurs often mention subjugation but of whom to whom is not clear. Of course there are other quite crass rumours that there were no tames back then, though it is quite offensive to imply that all rats were Candles. One must not take such talk at face value - many rumours circulate, and none are true.

Anyway, what is there to know about?

## Vermin

The lives of vermin are short and ugly - only as significant as they are bothersome. Those roaches, flies, mosquitoes, ticks, the rare worm; they are not driven by hunger, but rather windswept by it. To the rat however, the air in the tunnels is dead. A rat can stand still, proudly or meekly, on its four feet and sometimes even two.

## Industry

Bristol is a petite ball of matted fur, a chewed up kitten toy, a fuzzy amoeba, and quite pathetic. Most life here is pathetic, living off scraps of scraps. Morsels are crumbs and draughts are sips, and worst of all, tidings are oscillations. Bristol oscillates himself, between irritation and yearning. An old soul with no knowledge of the old, for there is no old when there is no new. He grew up in this timeless place, living off scraps of scraps. He has seen everything that life has to offer him, having seen pipes and drains and sludge and the rare fluorescent moss and the rarer dancing fungus. Sloshing floors and rough hard walls and flows from one pipe to another. Bristol is young but he does not know what that means. He thinks he is beyond wide-eyedness, but his eyes are closed.

Today he is excavating, just as he will be tomorrow. You would be amazed to see the industry of rats, digging depth-first stemming from the least significant of cracks in the floor. This great arbour, or eruption, or nervous system, or any other floral fractal that explodes in complexity in all four dimensions, is the *travaille du jour*, or rather *de la vie*, for rats who can work. The scruffy tuft of fur is not strong but he works anyway, because it makes him dizzy.

No rat is amazed at tunnels, perhaps just as we are unfazed looking at our avenues and tenements. But we follow Bristol because he is singularly dizzy of the tunnels. His little claws pull the soil away in front of him and his other little claws propel him forward to more soil, and his nose smells the snaking tunnelers around him slithering forward, and the tubes in his ears feel his own chaotic spiralling. He has tried and failed to explain to his coworkers what it is they are creating in their n-body motion - Their search for mineral has created a coat of knots more matted than any elder's hide. This has never been met with more than looks of amusement, and this is what Bristol's heart lives on. Scraps.

## Bafflement

The rat Hanad is baffling. Most of all to his father, who sees no practicality in hopefulness. It is quite baffling that a young rat could look down a tunnel and see the walls meet each other at the point at infinity, and still feel like there is anything else there. But he seems to be getting on, even if in the bliss of ignorance, and so his father leaves him to his machinations.

Hanad does not please his father with his ballads and waltzes but he does baffle him, and to the modern rat bafflement has become quite the hobby. Hanad's father's father's father Toronto was superstitious, and to him bafflement was a warning sign. The confusing was at least a bad omen, and at worst the flash and smoke from the casting of a dire curse. But that was a different time - the End had just happened not 20 years earlier, and there were still new and terrible things being born in the sewers. Toronto knew something he could not explain about the End though not for lack of trying. His nieces alone cherished the attempts at explanation and wrote them in a singular tome, keeping them in the family. Toronto did not agree to this at first, as he did not want to reincarnate old demons, but later he did come around as he thought that a book, no, a novel, might instead bury them for good. Better for it to be a history than a fact. Better to put all baffling notions on paper than in the twitching ears of a fearful rat.

Toronto's inclinations are fading in society these days, and Hanad's father is not the only one whose mind does not segregate history and fact. Many rats feign indignation at Hanad's music, turning their noses up and pulling their ears back when they hear the polonaises and ambients. But they listen all the same, and Hanad's mind reports on this duplicity and passes the good word to his heart. He is frustrated, failing over and over to reach into the five chambers of the rodents around him, and this only makes him reach further.

Rats live in the dark, and so a larger proportion of their hearts must be allocated to courage. This proverbial fifth chamber, or third ventricle, is often regarded as a malformation. It is improper that sometimes Hanad's courage is enlarged, and as his twinklings become more impassioned and his beats become more kinetic, his voice might spring up with a melody about an impossibility. Directions to a nest for a creature ten times the size of a rat, a lament of a regal bird's passing who was too small to be perceived, the healing powers of the blood of a weed. These stories alchemized into song by courage and hallucination necessarily offended, but murmurs admitted that they enchanted too.

## Walking

Dizziness is a seed and a question may water it. Scurrying backward out of an uzumaki of tunnels, one may clock out of work with only a speck in the soil of their intentions, and begin walking home in solitary direction. But a question - *What if I did something different tomorrow?* - may nourish it. And so it took root in Bristol's little rat skull, and his tunnelling instinct knew no better than to shoot the root further and have it branch out in a million directions until the organism could not be removed without pulling out all of the soil with it.

He thought in tangles. What if I didn't go to work? He thought in loops. Could I dig somewhere new? He thought in a ball of yarn. Can I break a new crack in concrete? What is concrete? What are mice made of? Is earth a type of flesh? Is concrete a type of skin? Will I ever hear the Earth breathe? Why do I breathe?

In this manic slew of questioning the dizziness took over, and Bristol found that he could only go where he went, whether that meant lumbering into the left pipe when he should have gone right or sniffing the floor when he meant to sniff the air or tripping forward when he tried to turn back or moving his back feet when he meant to move his front feet. He was hopelessly lost and did not even notice it. In his daze all he could do was keep moving. His mind now swung between questions impractical and questions incoherent, and in an attempt to stabilize him, his body could do nothing more than keep tippy tap hup tap tip tap tap tap walking, out of any place he had ever known.

## Crescendo

A muse is a siren. Hanad the musician was seduced by one at an inopportune moment. Not yet home from market, he began to hear a melody whispering to him, bidding him to come lie with it. It caressed his curiosity until a rhythm began to form. He would have found himself songwriting right there in the tunnel if he could find himself at all. Parts and arrangements assembled themselves, and the melody was joined by a throbbing bassline and a chorale harmony. Whenever it was close to letting him go, a drum fill caught him again and held him in its arms for just a little too short, and returned him to the tension of the groove. A crescendo pulled him this way and a sudden mezzo piano pulled him that way. A tritone asked him where to go and a vibrato answered meagerly. A meandering arpeggio turned into a walking bassline that trod with him toward who knows where.

A third turned into a sixth turned into a fourth sus4 turned into a tonic turned into a fourth turned into a dominant fifth that was just about to reintroduce the theme when it stopped. The hi hat was choked and the ringing snare was closed. Hanad's ears became empty as his eyes were filled. Amid the dark ahead of him there was a painfully bright glow.

# Part II.

## Running

### A.

Running for my life. Running forward. Turning left running forward running running. Turning left right opening the doors running through running. Running not tripping not tripping. I need to tie my shoelaces. I can't stop running I can't stop running if I stop running I'll get caught but if I don't tie my shoes I'll trip and fall and get caught so I'll stop running. Tying my shoelaces. Looking back and regretting it. Running.

*GCHTCHTCHTCHTCHT*

Covering my ears and running.

*GCHTCHTCHT chch tink chch tink GCHTCHTCHT*

...

Think please please think please

...

Running.

...

Uncle would say my whiskers are getting in the way of my nose. Ok. I need somewhere to go. A place. I can't run for very long because I'll get tired. I need a safe place. I need a safe place.

Or maybe I need a very dangerous place. He's a rat too. Twice my size is nothing at all.

### B.

I'm going to kill him I'm going to kill him I'm going to kill him I'm going to kill him I'm going to...

### C.

I'm going to kill him I can smell him Can I aim by smell?

*Chsch. chshhsh chch GTATATATATA*

My ears are ringing I don't know if he's still running I think I hit him I fucking hit him I fucking hit him I'm going to finish him off I'm going to kill him

### D.

I didn't kill him I've been chasing for 30 more seconds and I haven't caught up and my ears aren't ringing anymore and I can still hear some sort of pitter patter I think he's still scurrying the son of a bitch the fucking pellet the vermin

### E.

I'm still running but let's try to think. I can't outrun him and I don't know any safe places here but maybe I can get rid of him.

### F.

It is dark and damp. The sewers have a viscous flow - they twist and turn, but imperceptibly slowly. They are thick; The air is thick so you can only trudge through it; The sewers weigh you back. You can only run in slow motion. Some moments you're swimming in molasses, others in honey, others in solid solid amber. Others in outer space, where there is no medium to swim through. You don't know what you're swimming through, whether it's a river or nothing at all, but you feel like it's thick.

The sewers house millions of rats. Formerly billions, and maybe still - things like that are not known anymore, only speculated on. But millions of rats seem like none when you're inside. And in fact, the sewer is home to no rats, only to vermin.

### G.

I know a place. I'm getting out of the sewer.

## Furball

My brother sneers at me as he always has. How a brute can be a snob too I do not know; and how my brother turned into a brute is something that only I cannot understand. I had been coming to him the way I would come to him years ago, with concern and faith; I had walked in naïvely. But a year ago he redecorated his place to remind me, as I walked in, that this was not the right approach.

The garish white light like an invisible chandelier, gaudy in effect with the brilliance hidden away. The dunes of leather furniture that gave way like shifting grains as you sat on them, that would envelope you if you curled up. A quilt to knead but not to sleep in. Not a blade of hair on the mat. Not a speck of dust outside the litter tray. Not a particle of food outside the bowl. Not a fragment of claw left on the scratcher. I've met house cats through and through, but I've never known an institute cat even though I'm looking right at one.

"You're looking well as always."

How can I respond? I know I have mats on my stomach, overgrown claws, bags under my eyes, and a few whiskers missing. I've become nocturnal yes, but diurnal too.

"What's up? Something wrong?"

"I've had an issue with a few of your Officers. It seems like they've been mixing up the law and their... cravings."

"Ah yes, I remember your text now. My bad for not responding, I haven't had the time!"

He hasn't had the time to dictate his acknowledgement to one of his goons, who type his telegraphs for him. He must have been very busy.

"Well?"

My brother speaks casually but he sits upright and he keeps his eyes trained on me, calcified.

"Hey hey, no need to be so prickly, porcupine! What happened to back when we used to play together?"

A furball scurries out of a crack in the wall that I... hadn't noticed? It doesn't stick out in my brother's house, but it does in the Secretary's house. The furball is erratic, winding this way and that around the pristine room. Its scrappy grey fluff doesn't make sense amidst the luxurious reds and yellows of the furnishings, but I try not to let it distract me from the issue at hand.

"I'm serious."

A larger, lighter coloured furball with a great snout and beady obsidian eyes emerges from the same place. It is in pursuit of the smaller one. The face of one of the Officers scurries into my thoughts just as quickly.

"Me too."

The first rat scurries past my brother. His eyes haven't lifted from my shoulders. Without moving any other part of his body, without even a flick of his tail, his left paw swipes at the fatter rat as it follows. His right paw swipes it back, like dribbling a soccer ball. His left paw slashes it, and pushes it away at the same time. He pounces and smashes it with his front paws, grabs the almost-carcass with both front paws and teeth, rolls over, flurries it with his back paws, puts it down, and goes back to an upright sit. The rat is done. So says the Fuhrer.

## Dead

It worked It worked He's fucking dead it worked My plan worked Now I need to get the hell out of this cat cave what the hell
