## What I would do if I had a lot of money

What I would do if I had a lot of money is, I would finance a production of a gender-swapped but not outfit-swapped *The Lord of the Rings* starring Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe, Viola Davis, Yvette Nicole Brown, Brenda Song, and more, with a whole new soundtrack written by Oneohtrix Point Never for three Volca Keys, three Volca FMs, two Volca Drums, and a vocalist (Hannibal Buress, who would also be MC). I would attend this production in a Diane Von Furstenberg and Sailor Moon Cons, and ‚Äúplain jane‚Äù as they say, so as to not be gaudy. I would invite all of my friends, naturally, as well as Hideo Kojima and any transgender women he would like to have as plus-n. Admission to the public would be free but there would be a Berghain-style bouncer who is 3 feet tall. I would hold this event at an Amazon warehouse - no deliveries, sorry! The stage would be constructed out of tightly-packed boxes of inventory. ‚ÄúFragile‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis side up‚Äù, ‚Äúüç∑‚Äù - such things would be like Greek to me. And in this hypothetical I would not nearly be fluent in Greek. I would cheer gleefully as Legolas and Gimli overcome their deeply-entrenched racism while stumbling over a box of fine china that crumples under their feet, or as Gandalf and the Balrog (played by Eminem) fall into a pit below the stage, padded by a delivery package containing a feather pillow that some lazy fuck placed an overnight order for. And when the dust has settled, and we have learned who really is the Lord of the Rings, Roland TR-808s would be handed out to the audience so that we could applaud using claps more beautiful than hands could make. And tears would fill my eyes, and presumably everyone‚Äôs, when Dafoe leads the cast in a deep bow, humbled before his audience of the rabble and me (I would stand apart considering I would have a lot of money).

## Song lyrics

## I was into AI before it was cool

I think it‚Äôs a good time to defend my ‚Äúhipster‚Äù tendency, now that the zeitgeist is near-universally reviled and the word ‚Äúhipster‚Äù itself is outdated to the point of being historical. I‚Äôm so happy to have been a fan of MIKE for years now, since way before a clip of some corny white guys at his show went viral on Twitter. I proudly tell people about my taste in arcane and inscrutable electronic music with double-digit buy counts on Bandcamp - or quad-digit play counts on Spotify. I smugly look down on the Hegelian egirls, because even though I own a copy of Matthew Healy‚Äôs favourite book *Simulacra and Simulation*, it sits on my shelf (in the ‚Äúpartially read‚Äù section) alongside works by Mao Zedong, Alfred McCoy, Daniil Kharms. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the books I *have* finished! Who else‚Äôs shelf has Dambudzo Marechera, Anne Carson, *AND* Sheldon Axler? Yeah. That‚Äôs right. I know math even though I‚Äôm literate/I‚Äôm literate even though I know math. I don‚Äôt even *need* to talk about the tapes next to all this shit.

But what else is there‚Ä¶ üò± Is that‚Ä¶ Frank Herbert? Is that Walter M. Miller? What‚Äôs that? I wasn‚Äôt just into Floating Points and Pharoah Sanders before they teamed up with the LSO to record their critically acclaimed album *Promises*, I was also into machine learning???

I‚Äôve been interested in things before they were cool, and I have a tendency to steer myself toward other things that might be cool one day. I‚Äôve also been interested in things before they were lame, cringe, revealed to me by vulgar Adorno-ists on Twitter to be reactionary, evil. While it is genuine interest that leads me - I do really enjoy *Dune* - I do also find myself seeking out the new for its own sake.

And it is embarrassing to gloat about being in early. ‚ÄúI was into xyz before it was cool‚Äù - ok, so I was into something lame? And now I‚Äôm just into a cool thing, just like everyone else? And what about my youthful tech optimism? Of course I‚Äôd be very careful to navigate a conversation about that, lest anyone get the notion that I believe in the revolutionary potential of the blockchain, or that I pray to Roko‚Äôs coveted Basilisk.

I don‚Äôt want to turn the screen on and get a glimpse of myself only to see a vulgar imitation of a 20-something alt they. A person generated, or at least aggregated, by the algorithm. A /r/starterpack. A /mu/ topster. A basic bitch. I fear so much that if I stop truly finding my own idiosyncracy, if I let the internet memes catch up to me, I‚Äôll be an internet meme myself. Or maybe I already have.

There can be no truly alternative movement when you can find sLums, Pivot Gang, McKinley Dixon on the same Spotify playlist as J. Cole and Chance the Rapper. There is no idiosyncratic obscure schizo when Gene Wolfe and Ted Kaczynski have works that land among 4chan‚Äôs top 100 books. If I have such a unique and full-hearted love for the homeless, the Afghans, the trannies, then why is Vollmann always sold out at the used book stores? (Apparently the clerk sold *Rising Up and Rising Down* for $500!) Mubi is a subscription service just like Netflix and I don‚Äôt know a single other person who owns tapes but FIIO made the CP13. Why the fuck do I have a Walkman.

Being quirky is over. There is no individuality to be found in any form of consumption, that cannot quickly or immediately be re-absorbed into some sort of ridiculous micro-archetype, where Spotify can‚Äôt locate the five other white boys in the world who have 99% of the same thoughts as me. There is no combination of sources that I can take in that will offer me a reasonable guarantee that I‚Äôve thought critically, curated my own information, and resulted in a bespoke and independent view - not because it‚Äôs probabilistically impossible, but rather because I will never find those sources unless someone else has or someone else will. The Algorithm will nudge me and goad me and sometimes shove me along a path that seems like it‚Äôs leading away but ends up curving back.
