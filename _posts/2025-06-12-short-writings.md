## I think I'm dead

I think I'm dead. I have no social battery left, no patience with people or myself. I don't want to do anything. My interests are getting boring, and I don't have the energy for them even when they're fun - one Elden Ring fight and I'll hang it up, one chapter of a book and I'll put it down. My dick doesn't work anymore. I can't sleep properly, and I'm never comfortable ever - not sitting, standing, or lying down. I have no interest in dating, I don't think it's possible for me to connect with someone on that level - not because I lack the capability, rather my current configuration won't let me open myself up so much. That opening up is a necessary part of reconfiguration, and there is no bootstrapping this process. I don't get any joy from drinking anymore, it doesn't lend me any optimism or levity the way it used to. I don't take pride in my work - I do good work but it doesn't really matter, I've realized that being a diligent worker is no moral boon. My music, writing, cooking, and other creative endeavours have never really had the potential to produce anything good; I've always been at peace with this. My cat doesn't need me in particular. My sense of humour has rounded out, I used to laugh at everything and now I don't find much funny. I think all the sharp parts of me have been filed down to round them out, and now I'm just a circle, shrinking from the outside-in.

## Cuck porn

How beautiful she looks- how beautiful she is. Her chest rising and falling with her life-force powerful and beautiful, sweat on it and down to her plump belly. How beautiful she is, with her skin so impressionable, enveloping everything on it. I wish it would take me in, swallow me. How beautiful her bony pelvis, angled legs, gentle feet. A creature of love, love when she stands and now love where she lies, her bum a perfect arc into the sofa. I wish she would take me in. How perfect she looks there, perfectly in love with me, and yet without me. She coos to me, come, I want you. How lucky am I for her to want me so.

I wish she could take me in but she is full, so full. How beautiful she looks in my greatest friend's arms, I wish it were me. She calls to me, the first ever truthful siren song. How I wish I could go, follow the sound to her, meet the lips that call! Before they are silenced by my brother's tongue, the strongest one she could ask for - she gives herself to him, she is so kind. How dearly she holds him, her slender arm around his shoulder, around his back, on his neck, pulling him in, closer, closer. Dearly as she holds me; I can feel it too; I've felt it a million times and I feel it now. How lucky am I for her to hold me like this, even as she holds him. How lucky am I that she wants me, even as she has him so much.

## How to make a Klein bottle

Start with a square. The arrows are drawn to help us.

![klein 0](https://rikingurditta.github.io/blog/img/mat327 hw4 q3 0.png)

Roll up the square into a tube. The arrows have not changed directions.

![klein 1](https://rikingurditta.github.io/blog/img/mat327 hw4 q3 1.png)

Stretch and bend the tube. The arrows initially looked like they were going in different directions, but when we deform the tube like this it looks like they're in the same directions.

![klein 2](https://rikingurditta.github.io/blog/img/mat327 hw4 q3 2.png)

Inflate one end of the tube. Don't worry about imbalance between the two ends, they will be the same by the end.

![klein 3](https://rikingurditta.github.io/blog/img/mat327 hw4 q3 3.png)

Move the smaller end into the bigger end. Make sure the tube goes into itself if you're doing this in three dimensions. The material must self-intersect.

![klein 4](https://rikingurditta.github.io/blog/img/mat327 hw4 q3 4.png)

Bring the smaller end closer to the bigger end and line them up, like lovers looking into each others' eyes before they kiss.

Make them kiss. Connect the two ends so that their openings line up. Make sure the material melts into itself and the opening is no longer a crease. It may look sharp in my picture, but give it some curve.

This tutorial was originally written for my topology professor in my third year of university. He was wondering how to do it, and he knew that I have a few tricks up my sleeve, so he requested an explanation in the fourth assignment of the course. Of course, I was happy to oblige.

## A play

```
Two little kids are fencing.

1: En garde!
1: *jabs*

2: Touch√©!
2: *jabs back twice*

1: Die, ye dirty dog!

2: Nuh uh! It is thou who shall die!

1: No way! You're the one who drank my apple juice. Have at thee!
1: *lunges*

2: *parries*
2: But you said I could have it!

1: No I didn't. You're such a liar. *spins around and slashes*

2: *parries*
2: No I'm not!!
2: *ripostes*
2: You said if I won at checkers I could have your apple juice. And I won fair and square.

1: You cheated. J'accuse!!!!
1: *does a backflip and a flying kick and a sweep and two slashes*

2: But you said...
2: *splits into three pieces from the slashes*

1: Good riddance.
1: *spits on the ground and walks away*
```

## Another play

```
The stage is set up with a children's playground. Actor 1 is wearing a mouse costume, actor 2 is wearing a cat costume, and actor 3 is wearing a dog costume. All actors are adults.

1: Here I am, God, to receive your blessing. As your humble minuteman I reach out to you. I have delivered your cruel blessings unto others: Pestilence and pathogen have been a heavy burden on my shoulders, God, and I have carried them for you, for I know 'tis your will that men and rat alike may pass through pain. Sin is temporary, as you remind me every day. Please, God, remind me for the last time! Hail, hail.

2: By the by, here I am too! - blessed as well might I add. One man's trash, as they say!
2: *sneaks*
2: Humble servants are we all, and yet Nietzsche said we may be masters too.
2: *sneaks*
2: O precious fortune, my ma-
2: *looks aghast, freezes, puts hand over chest*

3. *sets sniper rifle down*
3: Gotcha.
