## Orlando

Damage, the scars in my memory, the things that are irrevocably different. As a joke I've said before that *fleeting* is a deadly sin. The moment washes away, cleans the wound.

I look up to Orlando, who could only move himself forward, move herself forward. Through world and across the time, my first inclination is to comment on his surviving the lost friends, lost lovers, lost body, lost soul, and my second one is to remember what Woolf told us about loss, which is nothing. Orlando: she found everything new of the world.

I can well up but that's it, I'm doing it right now. I want to cry in your arms, cry in a song, cry in a book, and I can't now. I think I'll be able to do it when reason comes to me: I want to cry not for the twenty four years of my past, but for the three hundred years of my future. I want full, heavy tears to fall and make me lighter, light enough to journey like Orlando through a million lives.

## One

Fingers grip on beautifully
Heartbeat footfall leaveningly
Rising almost impatiently
Lingering here never to leave
I still want your warmth in the heat

## Two

I'm trying to recall who I am, for you. I don't want to be self absorbed but of course I'm nervous; a little bit uneasy but trying not to show it. My composure wavers too when I notice my arms trembling. I hope you'll take the good with the bad. You're smiling but I can never be sure - I never learned how to read smiles. I'm smiling too though.

## Meow

Meow meow meow. Meow. Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow. Meow meow. Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow. Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow. Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow. Meow meow. Meow meow meow meow.

Meow meow meow meow meow meow. Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow. Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow.

Meow meow meow meow meow. Meow meow meow. Meow. Meow meow meow meow meow.

## I haven't had many ideas recently

A hurdle in creative work that many find impossible to jump is writer's block, a period with a dearth of ideas. Personally I've encountered this in several forms: the hiatus this blog has been on, a lull in my beatmaking output, eating the same meals over and over, reading the same tweets, staring at the same ceiling, reciting the same suicide plans.

What I find myself doing is writing anyway. I think it is frivolous and deluded to wait for inspiration to strike, as if it is inspiration that chooses my words, constructs my sentences, formulates the feelings filtering through my paragraphs. I don't want to wait for it to come to me, I'd rather grab things off the shelves in my head and try to rearrange them into something, anything, whatever.

## The limit of the intolerable

You're inside a grape. It's a bit mushy so you can move around but the elasticity of its flesh resents that. It's a red grape, sweet and tart, and like I said overripe. Fortunately it's flattish on the bottom, so it isn't wobbling or rolling over as you shift your weight in it. It's not good to be shifty but at least the grape begrudgingly tolerates it. The grape doesn't seem to you like it's happy to have you there, but that's what it gets here.

You're having a bleak, bleak *conversation* with what can only be called an "enlightened Nazi". He's talking ceaselessly at you about the transhistorical differences between peoples of different colours, citing obscure anthropological research and archaeological records, throwing in bits of Nietzsche here and there. Yes this *guy* knows about Curtis Yarvin, he didn't die so long ago, but he isn't so shallow as to stop there.

It's too hot. You'd think the inside of a grape would be cool but it's uncomfortably warm, and you're on the verge of breaking a sweat. You'd like to drink some water. You decide not to talk, so as to not dry your mouth out further, but realize that you haven't spoken in the last five minutes anyway - no time to get words in between racist anecdotes and out-of-context factoids.

You shift your weight a bit too much, and your *buddy* seems to notice. He does notice. Hey! Hey! Are you listening? I thought you leftists were open to discussing things in good faith? Hey! Hey! This is so, so rude of you. This is the problem with people like you. You think you're so much better than us but you're not. All that lip service to dialectics and you don't even remember that Hegel said...

Now you stop listening for real, though you know you'll pay for it soon. A glance out the grape: a desert, interrupted by a dry river. No fertile bank, no generous floodlands, just bodies, shoulder to shoulder, shuffling, some also in fruit, some also sweating, some shivering, many paired with armband toting cretins as if they can't photosynthesize enough of their own misery, looking over at thin stray dogs and horse-sized scarabs, beaten to submission by the blue sun, lingering too long above the queue.

## In bed

What are you doing?

I'm thinking! I'm sorting my feelings out. I'm reflecting. I'm bracing myself for the day ahead. I'm bracing myself for the week and month and life ahead. I'm figuring my shit out. I'm resolving the contradictions in my head. I'm giving myself space to deal with my emotions. I'm having a dialectic with myself. I'm being mindful of my ideas and consciously picking through them one-by-one, taking them in and discerning out what they mean to me, rather than letting them chaotically and randomly batter me throughout the day.

What are you doing?

I'm relaxing. I don't get enough rest, so I'm taking a breather. I'm staring at the ceiling, emptying my mind. I'm appreciating the comfort of my bed and my BlƒÅhaj. I'm taking it easy. I'm chilling. I'm trying not to be so uptight with my standards of productivity and allowing myself to just exist.

What are you doing?

I'm soothing my mind. I'm doing a few sudokus, doing my Duolingo, scrolling on Twitter a bit. I'm checking my DMs, my group chats, email, Substack feed. I'm just calming myself. I'm just keeping myself a little bit occupied. I'm stimulating my mind.

What are you doing?

I'm back to thinking. I'm realizing that I have more to ponder this morning, err, afternoon. I'm appreciating that my lifestyle gives me time to untangle the knots in my experience, so that I can make sense of what I'm going through. I'm thinking about the people around me and what I have to do with them. I'm thinking about my history. I'm thinking about my future. I'm loth to throw away this time I have to straighten things out, because if I do I'll certainly go back to being confused.

What are you doing?

I'm just reaching for my phone to soothe my mind again, a sudoku could be nice right now.

What are you doing?

I'm returning to thinking, yes, I've held myself from being distracted by numbness. I'm facing my problems head on, in my head.

What are you doing?

They're bedridden with a sickness something like a cold, their body intent on overheating and crushing itself in the hopes of stomping out whichever invader in whichever orifice or limb or organ, whatever it is, as if a low-burning solipsism and a weariness of the everyday will be the mechanism that leads our dear subject back to health, back outside, where there are more viruses and spores and bacteria than even their sweat-soaked bed harbours, as if the solipsism will burn out and the weariness will subside. No, the cure is cynicism: they have to get up, because what else is there to do? They are going nowhere with their antidissociation; better they explode, at least they'll be in a million places.

## Blog

The type of bullshit I typically write on here is not charming, not pretty. My inclination, and indeed the 100 words I just deleted, were to apologize and promise better, but really this whole blog is an exercise in self-indulgence that [I'm never sure if I'm secure enough to continue](https://rikingurditta.github.io/blog/2025/04/25/and-what-about-you/). The process of creation is borderline solipsistic: my world (or maybe gutter) is graciously freed from my mind. And the life of my work is diffuse. I'm not read at a book club, played at a party, watched on a theatre screen; I don't bring anyone together and no one brings my work together. It's painful to write this shit and put it out, painful to will my self to disintegrate in the ether. I don't have many ideas lately, but next time I have one I'll try to flesh it out, garnish it, make it enjoyable, make it something with flavour and substance, for you my readers, rather than continue to feed you nothings for no one.
