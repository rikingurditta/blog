[Jump to recipe]()

I fucked up. I like snacking on frozen peas, but I a few nights ago I forgot to put the bag back in the freezer. *The 2 kg bag.* So the bag defrosted during my excellent night's rest, from midnight to four-thirty AM, which is when I realized what I had done and put the bag back in the freezer. The next day, I wanted to snack on frozen peas, but they had all frozen solid together, so I realized I needed to defrost all of them to use any of them. So I did, and today I'm desperately trying to use them. Thus, pea soup.

## Ingredients

- frozen peas - a fuckton
- green onions - one and a half bunches
- gai lan (Chinese broccoli) - two
- russet potato - a
- garlic - four cloves
- cloves - four garlics (optional)
- black pepper - a buncha whole peppercorns
- salt - a lot
- olive oil - a little
- water - a splashful

## Directions

1. Defrost the peas. (PLEASE SKIP THIS STEP)
2. Warm up the peas in a pot of water, until they are warm.
3. Strain the peas and blend most of them until lumpy. Leave them in the blender.
4. Roughly chop green onions and broil on high heat until charred.
5. Poke holes in potato with fork and microwave for 5 minutes, or until soft. Chop up.
6. Break gai lan into smaller pieces using bare hands.
7. Put green onions, potato, gai lan, black peppercorns, salt into a large pot with a small amount of water. Boil until everything is exceedingly soft.
8. Put boiled veggies and pot water into blender full of peas. Blend until smooth. Pour contents of blender back into pot.
9. Repeat step 8 until most lumps are gone from pot.
10. The soup is still not thin enough. Ladle soup back into blender, add water and garlic, and blend until smoother. Pour back into pot.
11. Put reserved peas into smooth soup.
12. Drizzle olive oil and sprinkle more salt, to taste.
13. Enjoy!
