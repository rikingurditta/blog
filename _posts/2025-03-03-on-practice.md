I’ve been thinking a lot recently about Michael Parenti’s critique of modern socialists in *Blackshirts and Reds*:

> “No surprise then that the pure socialists support every revolution except the ones that succeed.
>
> …
>
> The pure socialists see socialism as an ideal that was tarnished by communist venality, duplicity, and power cravings. The pure socialists oppose the Soviet model but offer little evidence to demonstrate that other paths could have been taken, that other models of socialism—not created from one’s imagination but developed through actual historical experience—could have taken hold and worked better.”

(I’m sure if Parenti were alive today, he would have a lot to add about the socialists of the 21st century. But he’s in a better place now. RIP)

In the interest of gleaning wisdom from revolutions that do succeed, and being undogmatic and historically critical, I thought I should re-publish a great work of theory.

A classic of socialist literature and a great presentation of dialectical materialism (the backbone of Marxist thought), *On Practice* is a must-read for anyone truly interested in resisting the ruthless dictatorship of capital we find ourselves in. So without further ado, the piece itself.

# On Practice

## On the Relation Between Knowledge and Practice, Between Knowing and Doing

#### Mao Zedong, July 1937

Anybody tell you that I missed practice… if a coach say that I missed practice and y’all hear it.. then that’s that. I mean I might have missed one practice this year. But if somebody says “he doesn’t come to practice” it could be one practice, out of all practices this year… that’s enough! If I can’t practice I can’t practice, if I’m hurt I’m hurt. I mean, simple as that. It ain’t about that! It’s not about that at all, you know what I’m saying man? But it’s easy to talk about - it’s easy to sum it up when you just talk about practice. We’re sitting in here - I’m supposed to be the franchise player - and we’re in here talking about practice. I mean listen, we’re talking about practice. Not a game! Not a game! Not a game! We’re talking about practice. Not a game! Not the game that I go out there and die for, and play every game like it’s my last. Not the game! We’re talking about practice man! I mean how silly is that! We’re talking about practice. I know I’m supposed to be there, I know I’m supposed to lead by example, I know that. And I’m not shoving it aside, you know, like it don’t mean anything. I know it’s important. I do, I honestly do. But we’re talking about practice, man! What are we talking about? Practice? We’re talking about practice, man! We’re talking about practice. We’re talking about practice. We aren’t talking about the game! We’re talking about practice, man. When you come in the arena, and you see me play - you see me play, don’t you? You see me give everything I got, right? - But we’re talking about practice right now! Man look, I hear you. It’s funny to me too. I mean, it’s strange to me too, but we’re talking about practice, man. We’re not talking about the game, the actual game, when it matters. How the hell can I make my teammates better by practicing?
