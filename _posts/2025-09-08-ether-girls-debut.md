A whirlwind! [Tranzac](https://tranzac.org) was taken by storm tonight, battered with thundering intensity for the debut of *Ether Girls*: Toronto's newest "[frenetic/hypnotic/repetitive post-punk](https://ethergirls.bandcamp.com)" band.

After a heartened party trickled out of the *Southern Cross Room* rounding out this week's open mic, and while stern actors reread their scripts in the last minutes before they entered stage in the *Living Room*, quite a crowd built up. Friends, family, regulars, music bugs; young and elderly refilled Southern Cross, packed like pilchards in the space that was wisely vacated of furniture minutes before the show. Anticipation ruled during sound check, when some of us exchanged the bits and pieces we'd heard of the band's material. We thought we had an idea of what was coming.

The rough demo I'd heard a few months earlier was no spoiler for tonight's performance - Ether Girls more than live up to the description on their sparse Bandcamp, bringing an urgency to post punk that's never been paired with this much honesty. For each of five songs (the band's entire repertoire) they instantly locked into a palpable groove, like the most precise of funk bands. But unlike funk, instead of pushing through an endless progression, the band seamlessly switched between discrete riffs and rhythms, instantly recolouring a song like flicking a lightswitch. The singer could work her way up to a scream, but inhale the reverberation back in to cut it off, and revert to an irreverent rant. The guitarist could pull back his angular lines and instead offer bright embellishments between vocal flights. The bassist could shake the room, and on a dime pivot to resonating with the guitar. The drummer could spend a few bars viciously murdering the snare, before returning to the message he was encoding in Morse on the hi hats. I was in a trance, and then a different one.

Under the mellow multi-coloured lights, in the only part of the room that wasn't over-stuffed with bodies, they played the hell out of five songs, telling us about topics from shoelaces to Dymaxion. Without the grandiosity of a Black Midi, the rambling of a Dry Cleaning, the fuzziness of a Courting, Ether Girls debut with well-placed confidence in their enunciated power. Where will this boldness lead them next? Even with their virtuosity, will their straightforward delivery translate well to recordings in a genre full of excess? At the end of the night we were all satiated, full from the show. Some of us stuck around to glaze the band and to see *D. Golden's Stop-Motion Selections*; a few of us left through a couple of unsanctioned exits. And soon enough the satisfaction gave way to even more anticipation than before.
