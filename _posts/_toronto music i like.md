# Toronto has some cool music

Toronto may be a crappy city in Canada, but it is THE crappy city in Canada. Montr√©al is too Fr\*nch to share Toronto's characteristic Canadian blandness and Vancouver doesn't share Toronto's cynical non-despair (despite having the same misery as Toronto). Toronto has people from all over the world with every gender and sexuality, all of them harassed by police and ignored by mainstream white culture. Toronto has some nice birds in High Park and elsewhere but really there's no natural beauty. Our Great Lake washes up some of the most terrifying looking fish I've ever seen onto its beaches and they sit there and rot while children play on brutalist structures nearby. Toronto is a small city merged with its many suburbs in order for its evil real estate capitalists to hold political power. It has an evil real estate capitalist in symbolic power as the premier. It has posters of evil real estate agents plastered all over the city to help evil real estate capitalists sell their properties. Everyone who lives in the city is either an evil real estate capitalists, gives their entire paycheque to an evil real estate capitalist, or lives outside and gets brutalized by the police/transit employees/random citizens/the elements. Toronto is a pretty shit place.

Wait what point was I trying to make? I don't know. These sorts of articles usually start off with some context on the city, but I wonder about how that sets the tone. There's some good music here but I feel like that's not really related, it's not like the music is good because it cuts through the struggle or something. I'm sure if it was easier to put out good music we'd have more of it.

Anyway, here's some Toronto music that I love.

## Westelaken - [https://westelaken.bandcamp.com](https://westelaken.bandcamp.com)

I first found out about Westelaken when [Bandcamp featured them in May 2023](https://daily.bandcamp.com/hidden-gems/westelaken-self-titled-review), and I quickly fell in love with their music. The next day, I brought them up while talking to a barista at [Major Treat Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/majortreatcoffee) on Harbord, a cafe that shares its space with a branch of [Emissions Records Shop](https://recordshopemissions.com/) (and which serves great espresso by the way). She said that they're great, and I have to see them live, and she's played in a grindcore battle that opened for their indie-folk-country-punk act.

This piqued my interest, to say the least. What
