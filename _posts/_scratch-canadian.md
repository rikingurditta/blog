## The waffle SS üá®üá¶

I've been losing my mind recently over Canada's love of former Waffen SS members and I promised myself I'd stop thinking about it, but I couldn't. This may come as a shock to those who think that the [applause for Yaroslav Hunka in parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaroslav_Hunka_scandal) was a bizarre accident but our country *loves* fascists. Here's the kicker: Canada loves fascists *for fascistic reasons*.

The phrase *"scratch a liberal and a fascist bleeds"* is popular on the political left because it helps us form a clearer image of our political competition. It reminds us of the spiderweb-thin film of skin that is polite capitalism, which will allow screaming blood to seep out with but a single prick. Fascism is [The Thing](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-thing/); we don't know what it looks like itself but we know it comes to us with the face of human capitalism. But make no mistake, this does not mean that liberalism and fascism are identical. In fact, my point is the opposite: Canada commits crimes not as a fascist dictatorship, but a liberal democracy. There is no Canadian "National [Socialist](https://jacobin.com/2022/08/nazi-germany-national-socialism-hypercaptialism-social-darwinism-liberalism)" party but we implement Nazi policies all the same.

I use Canada as the subject of this piece because I live here (and also because it's particularly ùìØùìªùìÆùì™ùì¥ùîÇ), but really what I'll be doing here is searching desperately for the line between liberalism and fascism. But please do not try this at home.

## What does Canada want?

### Life; the bourgeois

Fascism is known to be a middle class ideology, and Canada might have the middest of middle classes. Life in this country reflects conditions ripe for fascism, like post-WWI Germany in the most boring fun house mirror ever. If you've ever wondered how Hitler got so many rabid anticommunists to treat their neighbours like scum, I'm guessing you've never met an upset suburbanite.

I think it is quite important to note the outsized influence of sprawling suburban hellscapes on the country. A telling example is the City of Toronto, which was a small urban area (now *Old Toronto*) until it was [amalgamated](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/torontos-struggle-against-amalgamation) with five suburbs. These suburbs had conservative political leanings, who now had an outsized say in the policy and planning of the core of Toronto. Furthermore, it allowed the revenue from the productive inner city to be reinvested into financially insolvent suburbs, basically providing a subsidy to home owners (read: land owners).

Maybe you've heard of Toronto's skyrocketing housing costs and the [associated epidemic of homelessness](https://thegreenline.to/stories/housing-feature-6-homelessness/). In [*The Tenant Class*](https://btlbooks.com/book/the-tenant-class), [Tranjan explains](https://youtu.be/J0HU7qjy52Q) that this cannot be called a "housing crisis", considering it is business as usual as opposed to an aberration. Canada has always legislated outsized power into the hands of landlords, and tenants have always had to engage in active struggle against them to survive. Tranjan explains further in the book that yes, this includes "private landlords", who own one or two houses to rent out as a source of income. Make no mistake - a rental property is a business, which is now usually [valued at almost a million dollars in Ontario](https://www.statista.com/statistics/604254/median-house-prices-ontario/).

Unstated in this analysis is the number of home owners there are. This comes from it being a good decision to own a home - owning a home has long been *the* way of passing intergenerational wealth. But this means that the wealth of ordinary middle class families is tied to land value, which leads to all sorts of antisocial behaviour. Obviously I'm not advocating for [mass corporate accumulation of residential property](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/29/blackstone-rebellion-how-one-country-worlds-biggest-commercial-landlord-denmark), but maybe there's a problem when ordinary people are working to [preserve homelessness](https://twitter.com/KamilKaramali/status/1365498132033863680), because a shelter might be bad for their bottom line. Maybe there's a problem when ordinary people want to [reduce the mobility of those who cannot drive](https://www.thespec.com/opinion/contributors/burlington-can-t-give-in-to-transit-nimbyism/article_2a97384d-a205-5770-a812-400686af4492.html) because buses don't belong in a high-value neighbourhood. [try to add more examples, esp from Biz] Let's not forget that suburbanism has always been a bastion of individualism, as part of the 50's American dream, where you own a nice suburban castle complete with a woman and children. I just find it appalling how the main way of "being smart with your money" coincides with the main way of becoming a capitalist and misogynistic flavour of antisocial - becoming a fascist flavour of psychotic.

## What does Canada do for it?

### Anticommunism; the Galicia division of the Waffen SS

*Class Struggle*, Alex Holt's [is the name right] excellent history of labour organizing by teachers in Ontario, draws a clear line through Ontario's continuing subjugation of teachers. The right to organize was not granted easily, and  and today the government does everything in its power to scapegoat labour power in schools for our poor [citation needed] education system. Strikes are, every single time, met by a government media campaign explaining to parents that their childrens' education is being compromised by greedy teachers (i.e. publicly funded propaganda against its own citizens). It isn't as if teachers are in a particularly good spot in their bargaining with the state. Teaching is a prime example of the socialization of costs - not only must teachers pay for their supplies and transportation, but also their own continuing education. Ontario has historically modernized [citation needed] [not actually - DELETE LATER] its education system by requiring teachers to meet increasing demands for certifications and degrees. Today teachers must pay for education in their teachable field, and then pay again for teachers' college. Plus, they pay to teach their classes with their time. In *[Wage Labour and Capital](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/)*, good ol' Karl M. explains that surplus value is found in extra labour time. Wages must meet the cost of social reproduction (cost of living, more or less), but this wage is irrespective of the time spent in a day working, so surplus value is created by surplus working time. I'd like to meet a teacher who doesn't spend extra time working every single day on creating and revising curricula, preparing lessons, grading homework and tests, giving students feedback and advice, supervising student clubs, and critically reflecting on the needs of their students. ("But they get summers off!!!" honestly just shut the fuck up.)

Teachers do not produce commodities and so do not produce surplus value in the traditional sense. However, a capitalist economy requires a workforce that is educated enough to work [cite The Origin of Capitalism], and the state is trying to provide that to its businesses as cheap as possible. (I am not arguing against public education just because it also serves capital "c" Capital, only that it is in Capital's interests to exploit the labour of teachers rather than in the social interest.) [maybe delete] Furthermore, it is not as if these costs are set by a rational market, considering [the high demand and low supply of teachers in Ontario](https://torontolife.com/city/ontario-teacher-shortage-is-ruining-our-education-system/). This is a government intervention to give teachers less.

Teachers are not the only example of labour's head being held below the water. There's also [list more with links]. Of course, this is typical of a capitalist system, but my point is that we delineate fascism from regular capitalism by violence and brutishness. In [*Blackshirts and Reds*](https://communistusa.org/a-communist-review-of-michael-parentis-blackshirts-and-reds/), Parenti characterizes fascism by "all-out government support for business and severe repression of antibusiness, prolabor forces." Maybe we don't see Canada deploy violence to this end, but we've seen it in the past.

Let's look back at the 1950s, a time of global reconfiguration. In Ontario and Alberta, there was a prominent Ukrainian-Canadian community with a militant labour movement. They had effective unions, [farm stuff], and even social institutions like dance halls. Meanwhile, Ukraine proper had a recently defeated ultranationailst faction which overlapped with the Nazi party. [The 14th Waffen  Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Waffen_Grenadier_Division_of_the_SS_(1st_Galician)) was the Ukrainian branch of the military wing of the party. Joining this wing required an oath of loyalty to the party and Adolf Hitler. Some members you might recognize are Yaroslav Hunka who was [applauded in Parliament to national embarrassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaroslav_Hunka_scandal), [Peter Savaryn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Savaryn) who was president of the University of Alberta and [received the Order of Canada](https://www.gg.ca/en/honours/recipients/146-13284). We can find more in the list of people memorialized as victims of communism, or in the plaques on various monuments dedicated to them. ([Chrystia Freeland's grandfather](https://web.archive.org/web/20170505142525/https://twitter.com/cafreeland/status/768200606695776256), [Michael Chomiak](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/chrystia-freelands-granddad-was-indeed-a-nazi-collaborator-so-much-for-russian-disinformation), narrowly escapes this list by *merely* running a party propaganda newspaper which was expropriated from its Jewish owners. He even lived in the owner's house! [citation needed]) These were world experts on anticommunism militancy, and had earned their stripes fighting patriotically against communists and Jews in their home country. So naturally, Canada turned to them when it wanted to quash its domestic labour movement, and allowed thousands of [war criminals](https://archive.ph/2AP0f) to immigrate, free to be hired as Pinkertons by the state or by business.

Canada willingly imported perpetrators of the Nazi holocaust; it imported them to continue the work they did in their home countries during the Nazi holocaust; it imported them to help in the anti-labour activity that it was already doing; it imported them to do something that the government still does.
